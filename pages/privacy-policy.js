        <strong>Cookies</strong>.&nbsp; Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to
        your device’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies
        allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used

        Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique
        identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your

        clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site and
        Services to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors and Services users,
        help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site and Services usage. We and our
        service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track
        email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are
        forwarded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Analytics. We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate

        Services, through your device(s), or from a third party) to help us and our service
        providers identify other devices that you use (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, other computer,

        <strong>Ad Networks</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Site may utilize network advertisers to serve advertisements on non-affiliated websites
        or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these network
        advertisers to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be
        interested, including our own. Ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic
        measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), LSOs
        and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize
        advertising content to you. These cookies and other technologies are governed by each
        entity’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these advertisers with
        information, including personal information, about you. We do not use network advertisers or
        display advertising on the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Site visitors may opt out of many ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital
        Advertising Alliance (“DAA”){' '}
        <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Consumer Choice Page</a> for information about
        opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used
        by <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/participating/">DAA companies</a>. You may also go to
        the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”){' '}
        <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Consumer Opt-Out Page</a> for
        information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding
        having information used by{' '}
        <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/participating-networks">NAI members</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA{' '}
        <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Consumer Choice Page</a> or the NAI{' '}
        <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Consumer Opt-Out Page</a> will opt you
        out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not
        mean you will no longer receive any advertising online. You may continue to receive
        advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e.,
        contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you
        opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional
