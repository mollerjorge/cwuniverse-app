            <p>
              3.1 Use of Third Party Offerings. Clockwork or third parties may from time to time
              enable User to use the Clockwork Universe Platform in connection with Third Party
              Offerings. Any use by User of any such Third Party Offerings, and any exchange of data
              between User and any provider of a Third Party Offering, is solely between User and
              the applicable provider of the Third Party Offering. Clockwork does not warrant or
              support any Third Party Offering, whether or not it are designated by Clockwork as
              “certified” or otherwise. If User installs or enables any Third Party Offering for use
              with Clockwork Universe Platform, User acknowledges that Clockwork may allow providers
              of that Third Party Offering to access User Data as required for the interoperation
              and support of such Third Party Offering with the Clockwork Universe Platform.
              Clockwork shall not be responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of
              User Data resulting from any such access by the providers of Third Party Offerings. If
              the provider of any Third Party Offering ceases to make the Third Party Offering
              available for interoperation with the corresponding Clockwork Universe Platform
              features on reasonable terms, Clockwork may cease providing such features without
              entitling User to any refund, credit, or other compensation.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.2 Access Codes. To the extent that Clockwork requires that User grant Clockwork with
              authorizations, passwords or other user credentials to a Third Party Offering (“Access
              Codes”) to retrieve User Data or to enable interoperability with the Clockwork
              Universe Platform, User shall promptly provide such Access Codes. Clockwork shall not
              share, reassign, divulge or disclose any Access Codes except to Clockwork employees or
              contractors specifically engaged in the performance of the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.3 Third Party Hosting. Clockwork may use the services of one or more third parties
              to deliver all or part of the Clockwork Universe Platform. Clockwork will pass-through
              any warranties to the extent that Clockwork receives any from its then current
              third-party service provider that it can provide to User. User agrees to comply with
              any acceptable use policies and other terms of any third-party service provider that
              are provided or otherwise made available to User from time to time.
            </p>
            <p>4. PASSWORDS.</p>
            <p>
              4.1 Passwords. User and its Authorized Users shall be responsible for maintaining the
              confidentiality of all user logins and passwords and for ensuring that each user login
              and password is used only by the person to which it was issued. User is solely
              responsible for any and all access and use of the Clockwork Universe Platform that
              occurs using any Authorized User’s account. User shall restrict its Authorized Users
              from sharing passwords. User agrees to immediately notify Clockwork of any
              unauthorized use of any account or login and password issued to User and/or its
              Authorized Users. Clockwork shall have no liability for any loss or damage arising
              from User’s or its Authorized Users failure to comply with the terms set forth in this
              Section.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.2 No Circumvention of Security. Neither User nor any Authorized User may circumvent
              or otherwise interfere with any user authentication or security of the Clockwork
              Universe Platform. User will immediately notify Clockwork of any breach, or attempted
              breach, of security known to User.
            </p>
            <p>5. USER OBLIGATIONS.</p>
            <p>
              5.1 User System. User is responsible for (a) obtaining, deploying and maintaining the
              User System; (b) contracting with third party ISP, telecommunications and other
              service providers to access and use the Clockwork Universe Platform via the Internet;
              and (c) paying all third party fees and access charges incurred in connection with the
              foregoing. Except as specifically set forth in these Terms or a separate agreement
              between User and Clockwork referencing these Terms, Clockwork shall not be responsible
              for supplying any hardware, software or other equipment to User under these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              5.2 Acceptable Use. User shall be solely responsible for its actions and the actions
              of its Authorized Users while using the Clockwork Universe Platform. User acknowledges
              and agrees: (a) to abide by all local, state, national, and international laws and
              regulations applicable to User’s use of the Clockwork Universe Platform, including
              without limitation the provision and storage of User Data; (b) not to send or store
              data on or to the Clockwork Universe Platform which violates the rights of any

              or entity established in any jurisdiction; (c) not to upload in any way any
              information or content that contain Malicious Code or data that may damage the
              operation of the Clockwork Universe Platform or another’s computer or mobile device;
              (d) not to use the Clockwork Universe Platform for illegal, fraudulent, unethical or
              inappropriate purposes; (e) not to interfere or disrupt networks connected to the
              Clockwork Universe Platform or interfere with other ability to access or use the
              Clockwork Universe Platform; (f) not to distribute, promote or transmit through the
              Clockwork Universe Platform any unlawful, harmful, obscene, pornographic or otherwise
              objectionable material of any kind or nature; (g) not to transmit or post any material
              that encourages conduct that could constitute a criminal offense or give rise to civil
              liability; (h) not to interfere with another user’s use and enjoyment of the Clockwork
              Universe Platform; (i) not to use the Clockwork Universe Platform in any manner that
              impairs the Clockwork Universe Platform, including without limitation the servers and
              networks on which the Clockwork Universe Platform is provided; (j) to comply with all
              regulations, policies and procedures of networks connected to the Clockwork Universe
              Platform and Clockwork’s service providers; and (k) to use the Clockwork Universe
              Platform only in accordance with the Documentation. User acknowledges and agrees that
              Clockwork neither endorses the contents of any User communications or User Data nor
              assumes any responsibility for any offensive material contained therein, any
              infringement of third party Intellectual Property Rights arising therefrom or any
              crime facilitated thereby. Clockwork may remove any violating content posted or stored
              using the Clockwork Universe Platform or transmitted through the Clockwork Universe
              Platform, without notice to User. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Clockwork does not
              guarantee and is not obligated to verify, authenticate, monitor or edit the User Data
              or any other information or data input into or stored in the Clockwork Universe
              Platform for completeness, integrity, quality, accuracy or otherwise. User shall be
              responsible and liable for the completeness, integrity, quality and accuracy of User
              Data input into the Clockwork Universe Platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              5.3 Accuracy of User’s Contact Information; Email Notices. User agrees to provide
              accurate, current and complete information as necessary for Clockwork to communicate
              with User from time to time regarding the Services, issue invoices or accept payment,
              or contact User for other account- related purposes. User agrees to keep any online
              account information current and inform Clockwork of any changes in User’s legal
              business name, address, email address and phone number. User agrees to accept emails
              from Clockwork at the e-mail addresses specified by its Authorized Users for login
              purposes. In addition, User agrees that Clockwork may rely and act on all information
              and instructions provided to Clockwork by Authorized Users from the above-specified
              email addresses.
            </p>
            <p>
              5.4 Temporary Suspension. Clockwork may temporarily suspend User’s or its Authorized
              Users’ access to the Clockwork Universe Platform in the event that either User or any
              of its Authorized Users is engaged in, or Clockwork in good faith suspects User or any
              of its Authorized Users is engaged in, any unauthorized conduct (including, but not
              limited to any violation of these Terms). Clockwork will attempt to contact User prior
              to or contemporaneously with such suspension; provided, however, that Clockwork’s
              exercise of the suspension rights herein shall not be conditioned upon User’s receipt
              of any such notification. A suspension may take effect for User’s entire account and
              User understands that such suspension would therefore include its Authorized User
              accounts. User agrees that Clockwork shall not be liable to User, Authorized Users, or
              any third party if Clockwork exercises its suspension rights as permitted by this
              Section. Upon determining that User has ceased the unauthorized conduct leading to the
              temporary suspension to Clockwork’s reasonable satisfaction, Clockwork shall reinstate
              User’s and its Authorized Users’ access to and use of the Clockwork Universe Platform.
              Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, Clockwork’s suspension of
              access to the Clockwork Universe Platform is in addition to any other remedies that
              Clockwork may have under these Terms or otherwise, including but not limited to
              termination of these Terms for cause. Additionally, if there are repeated incidences
              of suspension, regardless of the same or different cause and even if the cause or
              conduct is ultimately cured or corrected, Clockwork may, in its reasonable discretion,
              determine that such circumstances, taken together, constitute a material breach.

              6.1 Availability. Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, Clockwork will
              use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Clockwork Universe Platform available
              with minimal downtime 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; provided, however, that the
              following are excepted from availability commitments: (a) planned downtime, or (b)
              unavailability caused by circumstances beyond Clockwork’s reasonable control,
              including without limitation, acts of God, acts of government, flood, fire,
              earthquakes, civil unrest, acts of terror, strikes or other labor problems or Internet
              service provider failures or delays. Certain enhancements to the Clockwork Universe
              Platform made generally available at no cost to all users in User’s Service Tier
              during the applicable Term will be made available to User at no additional charge.
              However, the availability of some new enhancements to the Clockwork Universe Platform
              may require the payment of additional fees, and Clockwork will determine at its sole
              discretion whether access to any other such new enhancements will require an
              additional fee. These Terms will apply to, and the Clockwork Universe Platform

              of the Clockwork Universe Platform (“Beta Release”), User acknowledges and agrees that
              the Beta Release may contain, in Clockwork’s sole discretion, more or fewer features

              USER MAY EMAIL CLOCKWORK TO CANCEL ITS SUBSCRIPTION AT SUPPORT@CLOCKWORK.APP. While
              Clockwork generally intends to distribute a commercial release version of the
              Clockwork Universe Platform, Clockwork reserves the right not to release later
              commercial release versions of any Beta Release. Without limiting any disclaimer of

            <p>7. FEES AND PAYMENT.</p>
            <p>
              7.1 Fees. User agrees to pay all fees applicable to User’s and its Authorized Users’
              use of the Clockwork Universe Platform using one of the payment methods Clockwork
              supports. Except as otherwise specified in these Terms, (a) fees are based on Services
              purchased, regardless of actual usage, and (b)
              <span>
                payment obligations are non-cancelable and fees paid are non-refundable. User
                subscription fees are based on monthly periods that begin on the subscription start
                date and each monthly anniversary thereof; therefore, fees for User subscriptions
                added in the middle of a monthly period will be charged for that full monthly period
                and the monthly periods remaining in the Subscription Term. All amounts payable
                under these Terms will be made without setoff or counterclaim, and without any
                deduction or withholding.

              7.2 Payment. If User elects to pay by credit card, ACH or PayPal, Clockwork or
              Clockwork’s third-party payment processor will charge User’s payment method on the
              date that User subscribes to use the Platform. By providing a payment method, User
              expressly authorizes Clockwork and/or Clockwork’s third-party payment processor to
              charge the applicable fees to said payment method as well as taxes and other charges
              incurred thereto. User agrees that Clockwork may invoice User for any unpaid fees,
              including without limitation any amounts owed by User that cannot be processed. User
              is responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to
              Clockwork and notifying Clockwork of any changes to such information. User agrees to
              pay all invoiced amounts within thirty (30) calendar days of the invoice date. User is
              responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to
              Clockwork and notifying Clockwork of any changes to such information.

              IMPORTANT NOTICE – AUTOMATIC RENEWAL: IF USER SUBSCRIBES FOR A SUBSCRIPTION THAT
              INCLUDES A PROMOTIONAL PRICE PERIOD, UNLESS USER HAS CANCELLED ITS SUBSCRIPTION PRIOR
              TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE PROMOTIONAL PERIOD, THE PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION WILL CONVERT
              INTO FULL PRICED SUBSCRIPTION AND CLOCKWORK WILL AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE USER FOR THE
              FIRST MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION FEE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF THE PROMOTIONAL PERIOD AND EACH
              SUBSEQUENT MONTH THEREAFTER. THE PRICING FOR SUCH SUBSCRIPTION WILL BE AT THE FULL
              SUBSCRIPTION PRICE IN EFFECT ON THE DATE USER AGREED TO THE PROMOTIONAL PERIOD.

            <p>
              AS AUTHORIZED BY USER DURING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, CLOCKWORK WILL CHARGE USER’S
              PAYMENT METHOD EACH MONTH WITH THE APPLICABLE MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION FEE AND ANY SALES
              OR SIMILAR TAXES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON SUCH PAYMENT UNLESS USER CANCELS PRIOR TO THE
              LAST DAY OF THE PREVIOUS MONTH BY EMAILING CLOCKWORK AT SUPPORT@CLOCKWORK.APP.

              EACH RENEWAL PERIOD WILL BE FOR THE SAME LENGTH AS USER’S IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING
              SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD.
            </p>
            <p>
              CLOCKWORK REQUIRES A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO PROCESS USER’S CANCELLATION REQUEST.
              IF USER CANCELS ITS SUBSCRIPTION AFTER THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH, USER WILL NOT
              RECEIVE A REFUND, BUT WILL CONTINUE TO ENJOY ITS SUBSCRIPTION BENEFITS UNTIL THE
              EXPIRATION OF THE THEN-CURRENT MONTH FOR WHICH USER HAS PAID.
            </p>
            <p>
              CLOCKWORK RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MODIFY OUR PRICING AT ANY TIME (BUT NOT THE PRICE IN
              EFFECT FOR YOUR THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION), UPON ADVANCE NOTICE TO USER. IF USER HAS
              NOT CANCELLED ITS SUBSCRIPTION WITHIN THE SPECIFIED TIME AFTER RECEIVING NOTICE OF A
              PRICE CHANGE, USER’S SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTO-RENEW AT THE PRICE INDICATED IN THE
              NOTICE.

              7.3 Overdue Charges. If Clockwork does not receive fees by the due date, then at
              Clockwork’s discretion, (a) such charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 1.5%
              of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever
              is lower, from the date such payment
              <span>
                was due until the date paid; and (b) Clockwork may condition future purchases of
                Services on payment terms shorter than those specified in Section 7.2 (Payment).

              7.4 Suspension of Service. If any amounts owed by User for the Services are more than
              thirty (30) days overdue, Clockwork may, without limiting Clockwork’s other rights and
              remedies, suspend User’s and its Authorized Users’ access to the Clockwork Universe
              Platform until such amounts are paid in full; provided that Clockwork agrees that it
              will not exercise its rights under this Section if the applicable charges are under
              reasonable and good-faith dispute and User is cooperating diligently to resolve the

              7.5 Taxes. “Taxes” means all taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fines or similar
              governmental assessments imposed by any jurisdiction, country or any subdivision or
              authority thereof including, but not limited to federal, state or local sales, use,
              property, excise, service, transaction, privilege, occupation, gross receipts or
              similar taxes, in any way connected with these Terms or any instrument or agreement
              required hereunder, and all interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect
              thereto, except such taxes imposed on or measured by a party’s net income.
              Notwithstanding the foregoing, Taxes shall not include payroll taxes attributable to
              the compensation paid to workers or employees and each party shall be responsible for
              its own federal and state payroll tax collection, remittance, reporting and filing
              obligations. Fees and charges imposed under these Terms shall not include Taxes except
              as otherwise provided herein. User shall be responsible for all of such Taxes. If,
              however, Clockwork has the legal obligation to pay Taxes and is required or permitted
              to collect such Taxes for which User is responsible under this section, User shall
              promptly pay the Taxes invoiced by Clockwork unless User has furnished Clockwork with
              valid tax exemption documentation regarding such Taxes. User shall comply with all
              applicable tax laws and regulations. User hereby agrees to indemnify Clockwork for any
              Taxes and related costs paid or payable by Clockwork attributable to Taxes that would
              have been User’s responsibility under this Section 7.5 if invoiced to User. User shall
              promptly pay or reimburse Clockwork for all costs and damages related to any liability
              incurred by Clockwork as a result of User’s non-compliance or delay with its
              responsibilities herein. User’s obligation under this Section 7.5 shall survive the
              termination or expiration of these Terms.

              User and its officers, directors and employees (the “User Indemnified Parties”) from
              and against all actions, proceedings, claims and demands by a third party (a
              “Third-Party Claim”) alleging that the Clockwork Universe Platform infringes any
              copyright or misappropriate any trade secret and shall pay all damages, costs and
              expenses, including attorneys’ fees and costs (whether by settlement or award of by a
              final judicial judgment) paid to the Third Party bringing any such Third-Party Claim.

              Clockwork’s expense and reasonable request) in the defense of such Third-Party Claim.
              In no event shall User settle any such Third- Party Claim without Clockwork’s prior
              written approval. User may, at its own expense, engage separate counsel to advise User

              (c) Exclusions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, the foregoing
              obligations shall not apply with respect to a claim of infringement if such claim

              Universe Platform in combination with any software, hardware, network or system not
              supplied by Clockwork where the alleged infringement relates to such combination,
              (iii) any modification or alteration of the Clockwork Universe Platform other than by
              Clockwork, (iv) User’s continued use of the Clockwork Universe Platform after
              Clockwork notifies User to discontinue use because of an infringement claim, (v)
              User’s violation of applicable law; (vi) Third Party Offerings; and (vii) the User
              System.

              Clockwork Universe Platform other than as permitted under these Terms; or (c) arising
              from the occurrence of any of the exclusions set forth in Section 9.1(c). User shall
              pay all damages, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and costs (whether by
              settlement or award of by a final judicial judgment) paid to the Third Party bringing
              any such Third-Party Claim. User’s obligations under this Section are conditioned upon
              (x) User being promptly notified in writing of any Third-Party Claim under this
              Section, (y) User having the sole and exclusive right to control the defense and
              settlement of the Third-Party Claim, and (z) Clockwork providing all reasonable
              assistance (at User’s expense and reasonable request) in the defense of such
              Third-Party Claim. In no event shall Clockwork settle any such Third-Party Claim
              without User’s prior written approval. Clockwork may, at its own expense, engage
              separate counsel to advise Clockwork regarding a Third-Party Claim and to participate
              in the defense of the claim, subject to User’s right to control the defense and

            <p>
              10.1 Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means any and all non-public
              technical and non-technical information disclosed by one party (the “Disclosing
              Party”) to the other party (the “Receiving Party”) in any form or medium, whether
              oral, written, graphical or electronic, pursuant to these Terms, that is marked
              confidential and proprietary, or that the Disclosing Party identifies as confidential
              and proprietary, or that by the nature of the circumstances surrounding the disclosure
              or receipt ought to be treated as confidential and proprietary information, including
              but not limited to: (a) techniques, sketches, drawings, models, inventions (whether or
              not patented or patentable), know-how, processes, apparatus, formulae, equipment,
              algorithms, software programs, software source documents, APIs, and other creative
              works (whether or not copyrighted or copyrightable); (b) information concerning
              research, experimental work, development, design details and specifications,
              engineering, financial information, procurement requirements, purchasing,
              manufacturing, customer lists, business forecasts, sales and merchandising and
              marketing plans and information; and (c) proprietary or confidential information of
              any third party who may disclose such information to Disclosing Party or Receiving
              Party in the course of Disclosing Party’s business.

              Confidential Information of Clockwork shall include the Clockwork Universe Platform,

            <p>
              10.2 Non-Disclosure. Each party acknowledges that in the course of the performance of
              these Terms, it may obtain the Confidential Information of the other party. The
              Receiving Party shall, at all times, both during the Term and thereafter, keep in
              confidence and trust all of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information received
              by it. The Receiving Party shall not use the Confidential Information of the
              Disclosing Party other than as necessary to fulfill the Receiving Party’s obligations
              or to exercise the Receiving Party’s rights under these Terms. Each party agrees to
              secure and protect the other party’s Confidential Information with the same degree of
              care and in a manner consistent with the maintenance of such party’s own Confidential
              Information (but in no event less than reasonable care), and to take appropriate
              action by instruction or agreement with its employees, affiliates or other agents who
              are permitted access to the other party’s Confidential Information to satisfy its
              obligations under this Section. The Receiving Party shall not disclose Confidential
              Information of the Disclosing Party to any person or entity other than its officers,
              employees, affiliates and agents who need access to such Confidential Information in
              order to effect the intent of these Terms and who are subject to confidentiality
              obligations at least as stringent as the obligations set forth in these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              10.3 Exceptions to Confidential Information. The obligations set forth in Section 10.2
              (Non- Disclosure) shall not apply to the extent that Confidential Information includes
              information which: (a) was known by the Receiving Party prior to receipt from the
              Disclosing Party either itself or through receipt directly or indirectly from a source
              other than one having an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; (b)
              was developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Disclosing Party’s
              Confidential Information; or (c) becomes publicly known or otherwise ceases to be
              secret or confidential, except as a result of a breach of these Terms or any
              obligation of confidentiality by the Receiving Party. Nothing in these Terms shall
              prevent the Receiving Party from disclosing Confidential Information to the extent the
              Receiving Party is legally compelled to do so by any governmental investigative or
              judicial agency pursuant to proceedings over which such agency has jurisdiction;
              provided, however, that prior to any such disclosure, the Receiving Party shall (x)
              assert the confidential nature of the Confidential Information to the agency; (y)
              immediately notify the Disclosing Party in writing of the agency’s order or request to
              disclose; and (z) cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party in protecting against any
              such disclosure and in obtaining a protective order narrowing the scope of the
              compelled disclosure and protecting its confidentiality.
            </p>
            <p>
              10.4 Injunctive Relief. The Parties agree that any unauthorized disclosure of
              Confidential Information may cause immediate and irreparable injury to the Disclosing
              Party and that, in the event of such breach, the Receiving Party will be entitled, in
              addition to any other available remedies, to seek immediate injunctive and other
              equitable relief, without bond and without the necessity of showing actual monetary
              damages.

              Clockwork may monitor User’s use of the Services and use User Data and other data and

              BUSINESS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, EVEN IF CLOCKWORK OR ITS
              LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, INCLUDING
              WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY SUCH DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE LICENSING, PROVISION OR USE OF

              DATE ON WHICH THE CLAIM FIRST ACCRUED.

              12.3 Essential Purpose. USER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE TERMS IN THIS SECTION 12
              (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY) SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
              LAW AND SHALL APPLY EVEN IF AN EXCLUSIVE OR LIMITED REMEDY STATED HEREIN FAILS OF ITS
              ESSENTIAL PURPOSE WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER SUCH CLAIM IS BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT
              (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE.
            </p>
            <p>13. TERM AND TERMINATION.</p>
            <p>
              13.1 Term. The term of these Terms commence on the Effective Date and continues until
              the expiration or termination of all Subscription Term(s), unless earlier terminated
              as provided in these Terms or in an applicable separate agreement between User and
              Clockwork referencing these Terms
            </p>
            <p>
              13.2 Termination for Cause. A party may terminate these Terms upon written notice to
              the other party in the event the other party (a) files a petition for bankruptcy or
              has a petition for bankruptcy filed against it that is not dismissed within sixty (60)
              days after filing or admits its inability to pay its debts as they mature, makes an
              assignment for the benefit of its creditors or ceases to function as a going concern
              or to conduct its operations in the normal course of business and such termination
              shall occur immediately upon notice; or (b) commits a material breach of any provision
              of these Terms and does not remedy such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt
              of notice from the other party or such other period as the parties may
              <span>
                agree. In no event shall any termination relieve User of the obligation to pay any
                fees payable to Clockwork for the period prior to the effective date of termination.

              13.3 Termination for Convenience. At any time after the Initial Term, User shall have
              the right to terminate its use of the Clockwork Universe Platform for convenience on
              at thirty (30) days prior written notice to Clockwork; provided, however, that under
              no circumstances shall User be entitled to any refund of any fees as a result of such
              termination.
            </p>
            <p>
              13.4 Effects of Termination. Upon expiration or termination of these Terms, (a) User’s
              use of and access to the Clockwork Universe Platform and Clockwork’s performance of
              all Support Services shall cease; and (b) all fees and other amounts owed to Clockwork
              shall be immediately due and payable by User. Clockwork shall have no obligation to
              maintain or provide any User Data and may thereafter, unless legally prohibited,
              delete or retain all User Data in its systems or otherwise in its possession or under
              its control. In addition, within ten (10) days of the effective date of termination
              each Receiving Party shall: (a) return to the Disclosing Party, or at the Disclosing
              Party’s option, the Receiving Party shall destroy, all items of Confidential
              Information (other than the User Data) then in the Receiving Party’s possession or
              control, including any copies, extracts or portions thereof, and (b) upon request
              shall certify in writing to Disclosing Party that it has complied with the foregoing.

              13.5 Survival. This Section and Sections 1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.4, 14
              shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms.

            <p>14. MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
            <p>
              14.1 Notices. All notices which any party to these Terms may be required or may wish
              to give may be given by addressing them to the other party at the addresses set forth
              below (or at such other addresses as may be designated by written notices given in the
              manner designated herein) by (a) personal delivery, (b) sending such notices by
              commercial overnight courier with written verification of actual receipt, (c) by
              email, effective (A) when the sender receives an automated message from the recipient
              confirming delivery or (B) one hour after the time sent (as recorded on the device
              from which the sender sent the email) unless the sender receives an automated message
              that the email has not been delivered, whichever happens first, but if the delivery or
              receipt is on a day which is not a business day or is after 5:00 pm (addressee’s time)
              it is deemed to be received at 9:00 am on the following business day, or (d) sending
              them by registered or certified mail. If so mailed or otherwise delivered, such
              notices shall be deemed and presumed to have been given on the earlier of the date of
              actual receipt or three (3) days after mailing or authorized form of delivery. All
              communications and notices to be made or given pursuant to these Terms shall be in the
              English language.
            </p>
            <p>
              14.2 Governing Law. These Terms and the rights and obligations of the parties to and
              under this agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the United
              States and the Commonwealth of Virginia as applied to agreements entered into and to
              be performed in such Commonwealth without giving effect to conflicts of laws rules or
              principles. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
              International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to these Terms.
              The parties further agree to waive and opt-out of any application of the Uniform
              Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA), or any version thereof, adopted by any
              state of the United States in any form. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 14.3
              below, Clockwork has the right to pursue equitable relief in the state and federal
              courts located in Virginia, and User agrees to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
              such courts.

              14.3 Dispute Resolution And Arbitration; Class Action Waiver Please Read This
              Provision Carefully. It Affects Your Legal Rights.
            </p>
            <p>
              (a) This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver provision (this
              “Provision”) facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute (e.g.,
              claim or controversy, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort
              – including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or
              negligence – or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity,
              <span>
                enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability
                of the Class Action Waiver clause below) that may arise between User and Clockwork.
                Effectively, then, “dispute” is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and
                includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided
                to User (such as Clockwork’s licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors)
                whenever User also asserts claims against Clockwork in the same proceeding.

            <p>
              (b) This Provision provides that all disputes between User and Clockwork shall be
              resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of these Terms constitutes a waiver
              of User’s right to litigation claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or
              jury. To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
              arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award
              the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees). User may, however,
              opt- out of this Provision, which means User would have a right or opportunity to
              bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be
              represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class
              actions). BOTH USER AND CLOCKWORK AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL
              DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR
              OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY
              BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.
            </p>
            <p>(c) Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</p>
            <p>
              (i) For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, User must first give
              Clockwork an opportunity to resolve the dispute, which is accomplished by emailing
              Clockwork at legal@clockwork.app the following information: (1) User’s name, (2)
              User’s address, (3) a written description of the dispute, and (4) a description of the
              specific relief User seeks. If Clockwork does not resolve the dispute to your
              satisfaction within 45 days after receiving User’s notification, then User may pursue
              the dispute in arbitration. User may pursue the dispute in a court only under the
              circumstances described below.
            </p>
            <p>(d) Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</p>
            <p>
              (i) Notwithstanding the above, User or Clockwork may choose to pursue a dispute in
              court and not by arbitration if: (a) the dispute qualifies for initiation in small
              claims court; or (b) USER OPTS-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM
              THE DATE THAT USER FIRST CONSENTS TO THESE TERMS (the “Opt-Out Deadline”). User may
              opt-out of this Provision by emailing Clockwork at legal@clockwork.app the following
              information: (1) User’s name; (2) User’s address; (3) a clear statement that User does
              not wish to resolve disputes with Clockwork through arbitration. A decision to opt-out
              of this Provision will have no adverse effect on User’s relationship with Clockwork,
              but any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and User
              must pursue User’s dispute in arbitration or small claims court.
            </p>
            <p>(e) Arbitration Procedures</p>
            <p>
              (i) If this Provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided above
              (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either User or Clockwork may initiate arbitration
              proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS,
              www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted
              before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced or maintained or heard
              as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class
              arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of
              this Provision.
            </p>
            <p>
              (ii) For arbitration before AAA, for disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA’s
              Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for disputes
              involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In
              either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall
              apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For
              arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp;
              <span>
                Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic,
                Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by
                calling 1-800-352-5267. This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the
                applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or
                rules apply to the arbitration.

            <p>
              (iii) Because the Clockwork Universe Platform and these Terms concern interstate
              commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all
              disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent
              with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.
            </p>
            <p>
              (f) Arbitration Award – The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief
              that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to
              award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the
              proceeding. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a
              statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be final and binding
              on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered
              in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
            </p>
            <p>
              (g) Location of Arbitration – User or Clockwork may initiate arbitration in either the
              Commonwealth of Virginia or the federal judicial district that includes User’s billing
              address. In the event that User selects the latter, Clockwork may transfer the
              arbitration to Virginia so long as Clockwork agrees to pay any additional fees or
              costs which the arbitrator determines User incurs as a result of the transfer.
            </p>
            <p>
              (h) Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs – So long as User places a request in
              writing prior to commencement of the arbitration, Clockwork will pay all arbitration
              fees and associated costs and expenses. But, User will still be responsible for all
              additional fees and costs that User incurs in the arbitration which include but are
              not limited to attorneys’ fees or expert witnesses. In addition to any fees and costs
              recoverable under applicable law, if User provides notice and negotiates in good faith
              with Clockwork as provided in the section above titled “Pre-Arbitration Claim
              Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes that User is the prevailing party in the
              arbitration, User will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as
              determined by the arbitrator.
            </p>
            <p>(i) Class Action Waiver</p>
            <p>
              (i) Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate
              more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class
              or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or
              private attorney general action) unless both User and Clockwork specifically agree to
              do so following initiation of the arbitration. If User chooses to pursue the dispute
              in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class
              Action Waiver will not apply to User. Except to the extent that representative claims
              under California’s Private Attorney General Act (“PAGA”) are excluded from this
              Agreement (if PAGA is applicable), neither User, nor any other user of the Clockwork
              Universe Platform can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise
              participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having
              complied with the opt-out requirements above.
            </p>
            <p>(j) No Judge or Jury In Arbitration</p>
            <p>
              (i) Arbitration does not involve a judge or jury. User understands and agrees that by
              accepting this Provision, User and Clockwork are each giving up the right to a jury
              trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. In the absence of this Provision,
              User and Clockwork might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring disputes
              in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case
              filed in court by others (including class actions). Except as otherwise provided
              below, those rights are waived. Other rights that User would have if User went to
              court (e.g., the rights to both appeal and certain types of discovery) may be more
              limited or may also be waived.
            </p>
            <p>(k) Severability</p>
          </div>

            <p>
              (i) If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause
              above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this
              Provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action
              Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be
              unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court.
            </p>
            <p>(l) Continuation</p>
            <p>
              (i) This Provision shall survive the termination of these Terms and User’s
              discontinued use of the Clockwork Universe Platform. Notwithstanding any provision in
              this Agreement to the contrary, Clockwork agrees that if it makes any change to this
              Provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), User may reject any such change
              and require Clockwork to adhere to the language in this Provision as of the day User
              entered into these Terms if a dispute between Clockwork and User arises.
            </p>
            <p>
              14.4 Publicity. Clockwork has the right to reference and use User’s name and
              trademarks and disclose the nature of the Services provided hereunder in each case in
              Clockwork business development and marketing efforts, including without limitation
              Clockwork’s web site.
            </p>
            <p>
              14.5 No Solicitation of Employees. User agrees that, so long as the Subscription Term
              remains in effect, and for a period of one (1) year following the last Subscription
              Term hereunder to terminate or expire, it will not directly solicit for employment the
              employees of Clockwork without Clockwork’s prior written consent; provided, however,
              that the foregoing prohibition shall not preclude the hiring by User of any individual
              who responds to a general solicitation or advertisement, whether in print or
              electronic form, only job postings and social networking sites.
            </p>
            <p>
              14.6 Export. The Clockwork Universe Platform utilizes software and technology that may
              be subject to United States and foreign export controls. User acknowledges and agrees
              that the Services shall not be used, and none of the underlying information, software,
              or technology may be transferred or otherwise exported or re-exported to countries as
              to which the United States maintains an embargo (collectively, “Embargoed Countries”),
              or to or by a national or resident thereof, or any person or entity on the U.S.
              Department of Treasury’s List of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department
              of Commerce’s Table of Denial Orders (collectively, “Designated Nationals”). The lists
              of Embargoed Countries and Designated Nationals are subject to change without notice.
              By using the Clockwork Universe Platform, User represents and warrants that it is not
              located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of an Embargoed Country or
              Designated National. The Clockwork Universe Platform may use encryption technology
              that is subject to licensing requirements under the U.S. Export Administration
              Regulations, 15 C.F.R. Parts 730- 774 and Council Regulation (EC) No. 1334/2000. User
              agrees to comply strictly with all applicable export laws and assume sole
              responsibility for obtaining licenses to export or re-export as may be required.
              Clockwork and its licensors make no representation that the Clockwork Universe
              Platform is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Any diversion of the
              User Data contrary to law is prohibited. None of the User Data, nor any information
              acquired through the use of the Clockwork Universe Platform, is or will be used for
              nuclear activities, chemical or biological weapons, or missile projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              14.7 General. User shall not assign its rights hereunder, or delegate the performance
              of any of its duties or obligations hereunder, whether by merger, acquisition, sale of
              assets, operation of law, or otherwise, without the prior written consent of
              Clockwork. Any purported assignment in violation of the preceding sentence is null and
              void. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms shall be binding upon, and inure to the
              benefit of, the successors and assigns of the parties thereto. There are no
              third-party beneficiaries to these Terms. Except as otherwise specified in these
              Terms, these Terms may be amended or supplemented only by a writing that refers
              explicitly to these Terms and that is signed on behalf of both parties. No waiver will
              be implied from conduct or failure to enforce rights. No waiver will be effective
              unless in a writing signed on behalf of the party against whom the waiver is asserted.
              If any of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable that term will be enforced to
              the maximum extent permitted by law and the remainder of the Terms will remain in full
              force. The parties are independent contractors and nothing contained herein shall be
              construed as creating an agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise
              between the parties. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between the parties
              relating to this subject matter and supersedes all
              <span>
                prior or simultaneous understandings, representations, discussions, negotiations,
                and agreements, whether written or oral. Except for User’s payment obligations
                hereunder, neither party shall be liable to the other party or any third party for
                failure or delay in performing its obligations under these Terms when such failure
                or delay is due to any cause beyond the control of the party concerned, including,
                without limitation, acts of God, governmental orders or restrictions, fire, or
                flood, provided that upon cessation of such events such party shall thereupon
                promptly perform or complete the performance of its obligations hereunder.
