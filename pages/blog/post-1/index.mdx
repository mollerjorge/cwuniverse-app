<p>
  When sitting down to build your next investor update, consider beginning by
  identifying the thematic areas you plan to address with your audience.
  Distilling your update into smaller, topic-based segments will make for a more
  approachable letter with a narrative that sticks. Ideally the structure stays
  consistent over time. Settle on a template that fits your unique business and
  style, and keep with that template for each letter. As you build your update,
  remember that investors will value transparency and candid disclosure, even
  when the news you have to deliver is less favorable.
</p>
<p>
  In this article we’ve included some suggested sections, which may be relevant
  to you depending on the stage and type of your business. Try mixing and
  matching the sections below, and any others that are company-specific, to
  formulate an outline for your updates. Find a structure that flows well for
  your company, and you may find that constructing future updates comes together
  more easily and in less time with a template in place.

<h2 className='text-2xl'>Foundational Sections</h2>

<p className='italic'>
  Several sections are considered to be cornerstones in your investor updates.
  These sections should be relevant for companies of a wide range of shapes and
  sizes, and are of critical interest to investors. Start with these sections,
  and then incorporate your specific sections as desired.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  Your introduction welcomes your audience and explicitly conveys the high-level
  thesis of your update. That thesis might be a nod to recent momentum, or a
  theme painting happenings and plans across the company. The rest of the update
  will provide the supporting details, but investors should be able to gather an
  immediate sense of the main takeaway to come. This section can be read as an
  executive summary. If written masterfully, an introduction can secure reader
  attention for the coming content (and investor asks!). In the case of major
  events (which we saw plenty of in 2020), this section is also an opportunity
  to reference any macro events and how they may shape the future of your
  company.
</p>
<h3>Key asks</h3>
<p>
  Key asks are your opportunity to spotlight the ways in which your investor base can add value. These can include candidate referrals for active job listings, requests for warm introductions to key partners that fit a certain profile, requests for introductions to other prospective investors, or simply solicitations for advice and support on any business challenges. Don’t be afraid to make requests – you never know what help your investors may be able to provide.
