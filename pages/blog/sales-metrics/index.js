      Broadly speaking, when it comes to tracking sales or business development related metrics it makes sense to break them down into two summary groups: 1) activities and 2) results. Stated differently, it is important to track the things you can control, i.e., what you are doing, and the outcomes of the actions you are taking. As stoicism dictates, you canâ€™t control whether you will win the tennis match, but you can control how much you practice, etc. So when it comes to sales, while it is certainly important to track wins and overall success, studying the input efforts toward those end results is critical to continually tightening the approach and improving the efficiency of the overall sales engine.
